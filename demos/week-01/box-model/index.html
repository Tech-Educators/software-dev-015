    <h1>Box Model</h1>
    <div class="box">hello, I am 180px x 180px</div>
    <p>
      Despite the fact that we have given the box a width of 140px, it is much
      larger than that when rendered (180px)
    </p>
    <p>
      This is because it has been given a border and padding (the margin did not
      increase the size)
    </p>
    <div class="box box-sized">hello, I am 180px x 180px</div>
    <p>
      This box has been given the style <code>box-sizing: border-box;</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that the size we give it will INCLUDE the padding and border
    </p>
    <p>
      In BOTH cases the margin just most the boxes away from its neighbours and
      has no impact on its size
