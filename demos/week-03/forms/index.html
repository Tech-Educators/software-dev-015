    <h1>Forms</h1>

    <form>
      <label for="un-input">Username</label>
      <input name="username" placeholder="Username" id="un-input" />

      <label for="pw-input">Password</label>
      <input
        name="password"
        placeholder="Password"
        id="pw-input"
        type="password"
      />
      <button id="show-hide">Show/Hide</button>

      <button>Log in</button>
    </form>

    <p>
      We gave our input a palceholder so the user can see what it is for (before
      they type in it)
    </p>
    <p>
      We gave our input an id and our label a matching for attribute, which
      means they are "related"
    </p>

    <p>
      The default behaviour of our form is to put the information we typed into
      the url (as a query string) and refresh the page
    </p>

    <p>
      We are going to PREVENT the DEFAULT behaviour of the form using an event
      listener
