# Terminal Guide

## Basic commands

`~` - Means you're in the 'root' directory/folder (if you use OhMyZsh)

`ls` - 'list' - how you see all the folders/files in your folder.

`mkdir foldername` - makes a folder

`cd foldername` - 'change directory' moves you into the folder you've chosen.

`cd ..` - to go back up a level in your folder (go back)

`code .` - to open folder in vscode

`open .` open this folder in your file explorer (mac)

`explorer.exe .` open this folder in your file explorer (windows)

`xdg-open .` open this folder in your file explorer (chrome)

## New Project walkthrough

Assuming you already have a folder called `projects`

- Open your terminal (it will by default be in the 'root' directory)
- `cd projects` to navigate into your projects directory
- `mkdir projectname` to create a new folder for this project
- `cd projectname` to navigate into the new folder you just created
- `code .` to open this project in VSCode

Now you can create your files and edit them and run your project using the "Go Live" button
